Packages and Modules with examples:

==> Django:

        javatpoints,w3schools etc.

    --> it is build with python that mean it is a python module
    --> to develop web appications we have django or flask
    
    --> each and every framwork should follow structure i.e MVC
        m-model,v-view,c-controller
        model-in this model i will strore all database connections
        views - in this views part i will store all UI(.html files)
        controller - here we will keep our business logic(here we will check users request
                                                          based on that request it will give response )
    --> django follows MVT:

                    -->M-Model: for db connection
                    -->urls.py: before going to views.py urls.py will check coming
                        requests are valid or not,if that is valid it pass that request to views.py
                        otherwise it will shows error i.e request is not valid
                    -->V-View: here we will keep our business logic(here we will check users request
                                                          based on that request it will give response )
