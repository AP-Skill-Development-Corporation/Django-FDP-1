Good morning all:
===============
    ---> project creation:
            --> we have to choose project location
            --> from that location we have command prompt
            --> run command i.e
                    django-admin startproject projectname
                    --> it will generate two diff files
                            - folder with project name
                                -- this project belongs to admin part
                                    (update,delete)
                                    -- here you can find 4 diff files
                                        -->__init__.py: this file will convey to python i.e
                                            consider this file as a python file
                                        -->settings.py: we make all cjanges in this files
                            - manage.py: it is command line utility
                                - we will use this file to run our server,for creating users app
                --> we have to run servever
                    -->open cmd from inside your project
                    --> python manage.py runserver
                            or
                            python manage.py runserver 9999

                    
                --> app creation:
                        -> we have to open cmd prompt inside project lacation
                        --> python manage.py startapp appname
                                --> after this step
                                        it will generate few files those are:
                                            -->migrations: it will acts as a interface between dajngo app
                                                and database(orm to sql)
                                                --> all database  related files
                                            -->__init__.py: just consider this app isalo a python file
                                            -->admin.py: by usign this file only admin can able
                                                        to access users table

                                            --->app.py : app configuration will be happen here
                                            --->models.py: here we store all db related logic
                                            -->viwes.py: here will write our main logic

                                -->after creating app we have to register it inside our settings.py

                    -->urls mapping:
                        --> to create new url we have to use path() which is calling from
                                from django.urls import path
                        --> for these path function we have to pass 3 diff arguments
                                -->url name like 'signup/'
                                -->function name
                                -->name of the url(name='signUp')
